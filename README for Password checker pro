# üîí Advanced Password Strength Checker

A creative, user-friendly Python desktop tool to assess the strength of passwords entered by users. This application analyzes factors such as length, complexity, uniqueness, and entropy to provide real-time feedback on password strength, helping users create secure passwords.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Real-time analysis:** Instantly evaluates password strength as you type.
- **Advanced algorithms:** Considers length, character variety, uniqueness, and Shannon entropy.
- **Common password detection:** Warns if the password is too common or easily guessable.
- **Colorful, intuitive UI:** Friendly interface with color-coded feedback and suggestions.
- **Progress bar:** Visual indicator of password strength.
- **Helpful feedback:** Provides actionable suggestions to improve password security.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/password-strength-checker.git
   cd password-strength-checker
   ```

2. **(Optional) Create a virtual environment:**

   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**  
   No external dependencies required, uses only Python standard library.

### Running the Application

```bash
python password_strength_checker.py
```

## üß† How It Works

- **Entropy Analysis:** Calculates how unpredictable the password is.
- **Character Diversity:** Checks for use of lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and symbols.
- **Uniqueness:** Rewards passwords with more unique characters.
- **Common Passwords:** Detects and flags passwords found in common lists.
- **Feedback:** Provides a verdict ("Very Weak" to "Very Strong") and improvement tips.

## üé® Customization

- Change color schemes or messages in the `COLORS` and `MESSAGES` dictionaries in `password_strength_checker.py`.
- Add more common passwords to the `COMMON_PASSWORDS` set for stricter security.
